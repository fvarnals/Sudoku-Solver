## Sudoku Solver

I am using this project as a practice for coding in Python, following a TDD process.

### Details
- Language - Python

- Designed to solve 9x9 'Easy' Sudoku (i.e. determinable; there will be no need to assume and test possibilities on unknowns) and can be solved with a brute-force approach.

- Function will take one argument consisting of the 2D puzzle array, with the value 0 representing an unknown square.
