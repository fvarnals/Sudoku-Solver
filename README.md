## Sudoku Solver

I am using this project as a practice for coding in Python, following a TDD process.

### How to run

- Fork or clone this repo, and run using from the command line using ```python3 src```
- Follow instructions provided, to enter unsolved sudoku.
- Input can be in any format, as long as it is a list of numbers starting from the top left corner of the sudoku, following through to the bottom right (punctuation, spaces etc make no difference).

### Details
- Language - Python

- Designed to solve 9x9 'Easy' Sudoku (i.e. determinable; there will be no need to assume and test possibilities on unknowns) and can be solved with a brute-force approach.

- Function will take one argument consisting of the 2D puzzle array, with the value 0 representing an unknown square.
